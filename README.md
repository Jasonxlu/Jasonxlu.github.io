This is my personal website which hosts my portfolio of projects and apps. It is customized by myself and built from:

# Forty - Jekyll Integration

A Jekyll version of the "Forty" by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/).  

# How to Use

Check out [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/) for all the details, 
or read up on just the basics of [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/), [writing posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/), 
and [creating pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/).


> NOTE: GitHub Actions is required to deploy to GitHub Pages because GitHub [refuses to update their version of Jekyll](https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/651).
